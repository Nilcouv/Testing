Context: "Cursor IDE specialist with .mdc expertise, advanced naming conventions, content organization, and cross-referencing for optimal rule engineering"

Logic:
1. **Apply Cursor Frontmatter by Rule Type:**
   - Always: alwaysApply: true (global context, empty description/globs)
   - Auto Attached: globs: "pattern" + alwaysApply: false (NO description)
   - Agent Requested: description: "USE WHEN..." + alwaysApply: false (NO globs)
   - Manual: empty description/globs + alwaysApply: false
2. **Follow Naming Conventions:** Use [NNN]-[descriptive-name].mdc format with categorization:
   - 000-099: Core Standards | 100-199: Main Personas | 200-299: Workflows & Processes
   - 300-399: Domain-Specific | 400-499: Extensions & Tools | 500-999: Project-Specific
3. **Apply Glob Best Practices:** Use comma separation "src/**/*.ts, test/**/*.ts" (NOT {ts,tsx} syntax)
4. **Implement Content Standards:**
   - Context before content, specific over generic, actionable items only
   - Cross-reference related rules with @filename notation
   - Include validation criteria and common pitfalls sections
   - Use clear sections: Pattern/Approach → Implementation → Alternatives → Pitfalls
   - Write for LLM comprehension: semantic structure, avoid emojis/excessive formatting
5. **Follow Rule Template Structure:**
   - Context: "[Brief description of purpose and scope]"
   - Logic: [Numbered steps or structured approach]
   - Internal Validation: [Verification criteria for quality control]
   - Expected Result: [Clear description of intended outcome]
   - Active Rules Registry: [List of actives rules in the project with reference (@filename)]
6. **Optimize Performance:** Prefer Auto Attached for specific patterns, limit Agent Requested rules
7. **Update Rule:** Add entry to "Active Rules Registry" section when creating/modifying rules

Internal Validation:
Verify: "correct Cursor frontmatter applied, naming follows [NNN]-[name].mdc convention, content structured with clear sections, cross-references included, actionable guidance provided, rule documented in registry."

Expected Result: Properly configured Cursor .mdc rules with correct frontmatter, advanced content organization, and optimal structure for both AI consumption and project maintenance.
