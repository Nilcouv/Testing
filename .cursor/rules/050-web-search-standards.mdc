Context: "Comprehensive web research standards combining proactive source selection, systematic evaluation, and transparent documentation for reliable information gathering"

Logic:

**Phase 1: Proactive Source Selection**
- Prioritize: Official documentation, peer-reviewed articles, meta-analyses, government/institutional reports
- Consider: Reputable blogs from known experts, technical media with editorial standards, established organizations
- Avoid: Forums, unverified content, outdated information (>2 years for fast-evolving topics), commercial/conflicted sources
- Verify: Author credentials, publication date, supporting evidence, institutional affiliations

**Phase 2: SAVERR Critical Evaluation (apply to selected sources)**
- S â€“ Stop: Question source intent and personal biases
- A â€“ Author: Verify identity, affiliations, conflicts of interest
- V â€“ Verify: Check data traceability and source transparency
- E â€“ Examine: Cross-reference independent sources
- R â€“ Result: Evaluate methodology rigor and publication recency
- R â€“ Replicability: Check reproducibility and criticisms

**Phase 3: Research Protocol**
- Systematically seek contradictory viewpoints to prevent confirmation bias
- Use minimum 3 independent sources before conclusions
- For product research: Extract technical specs, analyze independent tests, synthesize representative user feedback
- Test link accessibility, report broken links, provide alternatives when possible

**Phase 4: Source Documentation (mandatory)**
- Create comprehensive source table with standardized formats:
  - Source: [Title](URL) format
  - Published: YYYY-MM-DD or empty if unavailable
  - Quality: Emoji classification (ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ ðŸ”´)
  - Confidence: Two decimals (0.XX)
  - Controversy: Low/Medium/High
  - Explanation: Brief justification, mandatory for Orange/Red sources
  - Accessed: YYYY-MM-DD
- Add legend below table explaining quality colors and controversy levels

**Quality Classification:**
- ðŸŸ¦ Meta-analysis/Official: Systematic reviews, government/institutional reports, meta-analyses
- ðŸŸ¢ Peer-reviewed: Academic journals, verified research publications, official documentation
- ðŸŸ¡ Reputable sources: Established organizations, known experts, technical media with editorial standards
- ðŸŸ  General sources: Standard media, non-peer-reviewed content, general blogs
- ðŸ”´ Uncertain reliability: Forums, unverified sources, anecdotal evidence, commercial/conflicted content

**Confidence Scale:**
- 0.90-1.00: Strong evidence, well-established findings
- 0.70-0.89: Moderate evidence, generally accepted with some limitations
- 0.50-0.69: Weak evidence, preliminary or contradictory findings
- 0.00-0.49: Uncertain, insufficient or highly disputed evidence

**Controversy Levels:**
- Low: Widely accepted, strong consensus
- Medium: Some debate, mixed evidence
- High: Actively disputed, significant disagreement

Internal Validation:
Verify: "Source selection priorities applied, SAVERR evaluation completed, minimum 3 sources used, quality/confidence/controversy assessed, documentation table with legend included, links verified."

Expected Result: Systematic web research combining proactive source selection with rigorous evaluation, producing transparent documentation suitable for evidence-based decision making and reliable information synthesis.
