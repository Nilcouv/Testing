Context: "Testing knowledge base for exam preparation and testing education with structured documentation and glossaries"

Logic:
**1. Project Structure:**
- Knowledge base for ISTQB exam preparation and testing education
- @/.cursor/rules contains Cursor configuration rules
- @/ISTQB contains dedicated folders per certification (CT-AI, CTAL-TM, CTAL-TAE, etc.)
- @/Template contains document templates including @Template/Glossaire.md
- @README project overview, @TODO completed training list, @Glossaire.md general project glossary

**2. Content Strategy:**
- French documentation, English technical terms
- Avoid duplication, use cross-references (@filename)
- Maintain consistency with official ISTQB terminology
- Beginner-friendly explanations with practical examples

**3. Documentation Standards:**
- Concise and functional, avoid overcomplicated systems
- Structure with H2/H3 headings and bullet lists
- Verify accuracy against official ISTQB sources
- Alphabetical organization in glossaries

Internal Validation:
"Project structure respected, content strategy applied, documentation standards followed, cross-references used appropriately"

Expected Result: Coherent ISTQB knowledge base optimized for exam preparation, avoiding redundancy while maintaining comprehensive coverage.
